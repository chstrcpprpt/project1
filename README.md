## Restaurants to avoid.

## Project description 
This application will display restaurants with known low ratings. The user can save time and money by using the application api database to make an educated decision on where NOT to eat. This application was also built with mobile in mind and is responsive.

The focus point of this application is the use of Javascript and Jquery DOM, third party APIs.


Additionally, this application needed to adhere to the below restrictions: 

* Use at least two server-side APIs - [x]

* Must use a CSS framework _other than_ Bootstrap - [x]

* Must be interactive - [x]

* Use at least one new third-party API - [x]

* Must have a polished UI - [x]

* Must meet good quality coding standards - [x]

* Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts - [x]

* Must be deployed to GitHub Pages - [x]


## Project Management
This project was managed by utilizing scrum practices. Tasks were broken down by features and assigned to team members with deadlines. 
* Jobs progression was tracked on a Kanban board.
* scrum stand-up ceremony was practiced when the team was physically present.

#### User Story

#### Code test:
HTML was verified via https://validator.w3.org/nu/ with no errors or warnings.

##### Limitations:
* The results rendered by the application are 100% dependant on the api used. As such we the developers are restricted by what is allowed by the api owner. 
* Both third party API accounts are using the free version. These restrictions have been adhered to.
* This application can be constituted as an MVP (minimum viable product). Therefore the options to customize search results are limited to two dynamic input felids.
